This can be further broken down into severely cost-burdened if the amount exceeds 50%. This is a huge indicator of housing insecurity.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: Table B25070 (Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income) and B25091 (Mortgage Status by Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income). We would sum the categories for households paying 30% or more.\n\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# 1.
