    "text": "These measures are often considered causal or impactful because they reflect underlying social and environmental factors that drive behavioral health outcomes.\n\n\nThis is a crucial measure for Multnomah County, as it’s a known driver of both mental health and substance use issues. Homelessness can lead to increased stress, trauma, and a lack of access to care, while substance use and mental illness can contribute to housing instability, creating a vicious cycle.\nUnstable housing can be measured in several ways, often by combining multiple indicators to get a more complete picture. The key is to move from a single metric to a continuum of housing instability.\n\n\nThis is the most visible form of unstable housing.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nUnsheltered: People living on the streets, in vehicles, or in other places not meant for human habitation.\nSheltered: People in emergency shelters, transitional housing, or domestic violence shelters.\n\nPrimary Source: Multnomah County Homeless Services Department. Shows monthly counts of how many people are experiencing homelessness in Multnomah County, broken down by sheltered vs. unsheltered. Date range available: January 2024 to present (monthly).\nSecondary Source: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). They publish the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress, which includes point-in-time counts of homelessness. Date range available: 2007-2024 (yearly).\nPotential Source: The ideal source would be the actual ‘By Name List of people experiencing homelessness’ maintained by the Multnomah County Homeless Services Department. This would provide the most accurate and up-to-date counts, including demographic breakdowns.\nHow to Access: This data is saved in data/homelessness_counts_multnomah_2007-present.csv in this project repository. This file needs to be updated by hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA household is considered “cost-burdened” if it spends more than 30% of its income on housing costs, including rent/mortgage and utilities. This can be further broken down into severely cost-burdened if the amount exceeds 50%. This is a huge indicator of housing insecurity.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: Table B25070 (Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income) and B25091 (Mortgage Status by Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income). We would sum the categories for households paying 30% or more.\n\n\n\n\nThis refers to people living with friends or family because they have no other place to go. This is a hidden form of homelessness and a major sign of housing instability.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access in R: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: This is harder to measure directly, but a common proxy is to use relationship data from tables like B11016 (Household Type by Household Size) to identify households with multiple families or non-relatives.\n\n\n\n\nThis is measured by the number of times a person or family moves within a specific period (e.g., two or more moves in a year). It indicates a lack of stable residence.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access in R: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: Table B07003 (Geographical Mobility in the Past Year) is a direct measure of how many people have moved within the last year.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of formal evictions filed in the court system is a direct measure of housing loss and a strong predictor of future homelessness.\n\nGo to the Eviction Lab’s data download page: https://evictionlab.org/data/\nFind the download link for their county-level data. It will be a single CSV file containing data for all counties in the U.S.\nDownload the file and save it into your R project directory. For organizational purposes, I recommend creating a subfolder named data/ and placing the file there (e.g., your-project-folder/data/counties.csv).\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh unemployment is directly correlated with increased rates of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. It’s an economic indicator with significant behavioral health consequences.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). They manage the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program.\nHow to Access in R: There are a few packages, like blscrapeR, or we can build a query to hit the BLS API directly. The API is free to use.\nKey Variables: The API allows you to query for the unemployment rate (seasonally and not seasonally adjusted) for specific areas, including Multnomah County.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t just about the number of clinics but also about patient-to-provider ratios, geographic distribution of services, and the number of people with health insurance. Audits have shown that Multnomah County’s ability to serve those with serious mental illness is limited, making this an especially impactful measure.\n\nPrimary Source: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).\n\n\n\nHow to Access in R: HRSA has a data portal with downloadable datasets and some API endpoints. The NPPES NPI registry can be downloaded as a large CSV file. We could write code to download and process these files.\nKey Variables: HRSA data includes information on Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). We can use this to calculate provider-to-population ratios for mental health professionals.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the HRSA Data Warehouse\n\nGo to the main portal: https://data.hrsa.gov/\n\nFind the HPSA Data\n\nUse the search bar and look for “Health Professional Shortage Areas” or “HPSA”. You should find datasets related to designated HPSAs. Look for a nationwide file that includes mental health designations.\n\nDownload the Data File\n\nFind the option to download the data, usually as a CSV file.\nSave this file into your data/ subfolder. For this example, let’s assume the file is named mental_health_hpsa.csv.\n\n\nPart 2: Code to Process the HPSA Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be measured through surveys or community engagement data. A strong sense of community and social support can act as a protective factor against behavioral health crises.\n\nPrimary Source: This is difficult to measure with administrative data. The best sources are often surveys. For a good proxy, we can use data from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps.\nHow to Access in R: They provide downloadable data files. We could also check their source data (e.g., the U.S. Religion Census) to see if there are APIs available.\nKey Variables: They have a measure called “Social Associations,” which is the number of membership associations per 10,000 people.\n\nRe-creating the Penn State Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development Social Capital Index.\n\n1. Association Density (Establishments per 1,000 people)\nThe original study used the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset to count the number of establishments for specific North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. We can do the same thing using the tidycensus package, which has a function specifically for the CBP. The latest available CBP data is for 2022.\nHere’s the code to get the counts for all the association types, sum them up, and calculate the rate per 1,000 people.\n\n\n\nData Source: The MIT Election Data and Science Lab. They compile the most comprehensive county-level election results.\nMost Recent Data: The 2020 Presidential Election.\nProcess: We’ll download their data file, load it into R, and filter for Multnomah County. We’ll then divide the total votes cast by the voting-age population for that year (which we can get from tidycensus).\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the MIT Election Lab Dataverse\n\nGo to their data repository: https://electionlab.mit.edu/data\n\nFind and Download the File\n\nLocate the dataset for “U.S. President 1976-2020”.\nDownload the county-level data file. It is typically named 1976-2020-president.csv.\nSave this file into your data/ subfolder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis R code will load the election file, calculate the total votes cast in Multnomah County in 2020, fetch the voting-age population from the 2020 Census, and compute the final turnout rate.\n\n\n\nData Source: The U.S. Census Bureau publishes final self-response rates for the 2020 Census.\nMost Recent Data: 2020.\nProcess: We can download the official response rate file, load it into R, and look up the rate for Multnomah County. This is a straightforward lookup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Census Bureau’s Data Page\n\nThe data is available on the “2020 Census Self-Response Rates” page. You can find the final data files here: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/2020-census-self-response-rates.html\n\nFind and Download the File\n\nLook for the link to the final response rates, usually available as a single downloadable file containing data for all counties.\nDownload the file and save it into your data/ subfolder. Let’s assume you’ve named it 2020_census_response_rates.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis R code will load the file, clean the column names, and then filter down to the exact value for Multnomah County.\n\n\n\nData Source: The National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), as noted in the original study. This data is based on IRS records of tax-exempt organizations.\nMost Recent Data: Data is available for recent years (e.g., 2022 or 2023).\nProcess: This requires downloading the IRS Business Master File for exempt organizations from the NCCS website. We would then load this large file and filter it for non-international organizations located in Multnomah County, then calculate the rate per 10,000 people.\n\nThis measure captures a broad range of community organizations that the previous establishment counts might miss. The authoritative source for this is the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), which compiles data from IRS records on all registered tax-exempt organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the NCCS Website\n\nGo to the NCCS data download page: https://nccs.urban.org/data-statistics/get-data\n\nCreate a Free Account\n\nYou will need to register for a free account to access the datasets.\n\nFind and Download the File\n\nLook for the IRS Business Master File (BMF). This is a complete list of all active tax-exempt organizations.\nDownload the most recently available version for the entire U.S. It will be a very large CSV file.\nSave this file into your data/ subfolder. For our example, we’ll assume the file is named bmf-2024.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis R code will load the large BMF file, perform the necessary filtering, get the population for the same year, and calculate the final density rate. The original study excluded non-profits with an “international approach,” which we’ll do by filtering out organizations with an NTEE code starting with “Q” (International, Foreign Affairs).\n\nLet’s build the final index.\nTo do this using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we first need to build a basis for comparison. PCA works by finding the main patterns in a dataset with multiple entries. Therefore, to calculate a meaningful score for Multnomah County, we first need to gather the data for all 36 counties in Oregon.\nThis process will create a “ruler” against which we can measure Multnomah County. The final code block below is comprehensive; it will:\n\nGather the four factors for every county in Oregon.\nCombine and clean the data.\nPerform the PCA to create the index.\nShow you where Multnomah County ranks in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscale(pca_data): This is a crucial step that standardizes the four factors. It converts each value into a Z-score, telling us how many standard deviations it is from the state-wide mean. This ensures that a factor with a large scale (like turnout_rate near 80) doesn’t dominate a factor with a small scale (like association_rate near 5).\nprcomp(scaled_data): This is the function that runs the PCA. It analyzes the relationships between the four factors and creates new, uncorrelated variables called “principal components.”\npca_result$x[, \"PC1\"]: We extract the first principal component (PC1). This component is the one that captures the largest possible amount of shared information across all four of our input factors. It is, in essence, the strongest underlying pattern in the data, which we are defining as our social capital index. A higher score means the county tended to score higher across all the input measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis score measures a range of childhood traumas. High ACE scores in a population are a strong predictor of poor behavioral and physical health outcomes later in life. This is a foundational, causal measure for long-term health.\n\nPrimary Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the CDC. Many states, including Oregon, use an ACEs module in their BRFSS surveys.\nHow to Access in R: The CDC provides public-use data files. We can use the survey and srvyr packages in R to analyze this complex survey data correctly. We would look for Oregon’s specific BRFSS data to see if county-level estimates are available."

We would start by exploring OHA’s public data portals. If not available, this would likely require a formal data request.\n\n\nPart 1: Guidance for Querying ESSENCE\nTo get data on Emergency Department (ED) visits for behavioral health crises, you’ll want to build a query that captures visits for mental health conditions, substance use, overdoses, and suicide-related behaviors. Here’s a recommended approach:\n\nUse Pre-built Syndromes First:\n\nCheck if your jurisdiction’s ESSENCE has pre-built syndromes like “Mental Health,” “Substance Use,” or “Suicide and Self-Harm.” These are often the most reliable and have been validated locally.\n\nQuery the Chief Complaint (CC) and Discharge Diagnosis (DD) Fields:\n\nIf you build a custom query, use a combination of keywords in the chief complaint and ICD-10 codes in the diagnosis fields.\n\nDefine Your Terms:\n\nFor Mental Health Crises:\n\nKeywords: anxiety, depression, psychosis, psychiatric, behavioral health, bipolar, schizophrenia, homicidal ideation\nICD-10 Codes: The F00-F99 block (“Mental, Behavioral and Neurodevelopmental disorders”) is your primary tool. You can select the whole block or specific ranges like F10-F19 (substance use disorders), F20-F29 (schizophrenia), F30-F39 (mood disorders), F40-F48 (anxiety disorders).\n\nFor Suicide and Self-Harm:\n\nKeywords: suicide, suicidal, self harm, cutting, SI (suicidal ideation)\nICD-10 Codes: T14.91 (suicide attempt), X60-X84 (intentional self-harm).\n\nFor Overdoses:\n\nKeywords: overdose, OD, ingestion\nICD-10 Codes: T36-T50 (poisoning by drugs).\n\n\nSet Query Parameters:\n\nTime Period: Select your desired date range (e.g., the last five years).\nGeography: Filter for hospitals located in Multnomah County.\nExport: Run the query and export the results as a time-series (e.g., weekly counts). Be sure to export it as a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: R Code for Analyzing the Exported Data\nOnce you have the CSV file from ESSENCE, this R code provides a template to load, clean, and visualize it. You may need to adjust the column names in the code to match your specific export."

    "text": "This is a crucial measure for Multnomah County, as it’s a known driver of both mental health and substance use issues. Homelessness can lead to increased stress, trauma, and a lack of access to care, while substance use and mental illness can contribute to housing instability, creating a vicious cycle.\nUnstable housing can be measured in several ways, often by combining multiple indicators to get a more complete picture. The key is to move from a single metric to a continuum of housing instability.\n\n\nThis is the most visible form of unstable housing.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nUnsheltered: People living on the streets, in vehicles, or in other places not meant for human habitation.\nSheltered: People in emergency shelters, transitional housing, or domestic violence shelters.\n\nPrimary Source: Multnomah County Homeless Services Department. Shows monthly counts of how many people are experiencing homelessness in Multnomah County, broken down by sheltered vs. unsheltered. Date range available: January 2024 to present (monthly).\nSecondary Source: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). They publish the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress, which includes point-in-time counts of homelessness. Date range available: 2007-2024 (yearly).\nPotential Source: The ideal source would be the actual ‘By Name List of people experiencing homelessness’ maintained by the Multnomah County Homeless Services Department. This would provide the most accurate and up-to-date counts, including demographic breakdowns.\nHow to Access: This data is saved in data/homelessness_counts_multnomah_2007-present.csv in this project repository. This file needs to be updated by hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA household is considered “cost-burdened” if it spends more than 30% of its income on housing costs, including rent/mortgage and utilities. This can be further broken down into severely cost-burdened if the amount exceeds 50%. This is a huge indicator of housing insecurity.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: Table B25070 (Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income) and B25091 (Mortgage Status by Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income). We would sum the categories for households paying 30% or more.\n\n\n\n\nThis refers to people living with friends or family because they have no other place to go. This is a hidden form of homelessness and a major sign of housing instability.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access in R: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: This is harder to measure directly, but a common proxy is to use relationship data from tables like B11016 (Household Type by Household Size) to identify households with multiple families or non-relatives.\n\n\n\n\nThis is measured by the number of times a person or family moves within a specific period (e.g., two or more moves in a year). It indicates a lack of stable residence.\n\nPrimary Source: U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is the gold standard for this type of socioeconomic data at small geographic levels.\nHow to Access in R: The tidycensus package is perfect for this. It provides a straightforward way to query the Census API and get data directly into a tidy tibble.\nKey Variables: Table B07003 (Geographical Mobility in the Past Year) is a direct measure of how many people have moved within the last year.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of formal evictions filed in the court system is a direct measure of housing loss and a strong predictor of future homelessness.\n\nGo to the Eviction Lab’s data download page: https://evictionlab.org/data/\nFind the download link for their county-level data. It will be a single CSV file containing data for all counties in the U.S.\nDownload the file and save it into your R project directory. For organizational purposes, I recommend creating a subfolder named data/ and placing the file there (e.g., your-project-folder/data/counties.csv)."
